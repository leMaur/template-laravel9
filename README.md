# Laravel 9 Template

Are you frustrated to start a new project and having to install and configure Pest, Dusk, Phpstan, Php-cs-fixer, etc...?
Me, too! This is why I created this template repo.

All the tools I use on my daily basis are pre-installed and configured. Productive since first commit!  

**So, what's the difference from installing Laravel?**  

✅ Laravel 9 _(yes, the new version)_  
✅ Php 8.1 by default _(because we look forward 😎)_  
✅ Pest test suite  
✅ Dusk test suite  
✅ Infection mutation test suite _(what is this 🤔? [take a look](https://infection.github.io/guide))_  
✅ Phpstan _(because your project NEEDS static analysis, I promise!)_  
✅ Php-Cs-Fixer _(a clean codebase is like a zen garden)_  
✅ Rector _(automatic refactoring to keep the codebase in line with coding standards)_  

For more details you can check [Toolbox](https://github.com/leMaur/toolbox).
